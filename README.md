# Trie-of-Rules

## Overview

The `Trie-of-Rules` project is based on advanced research in **Association Rule Mining (ARM)** and introduces innovative methods for processing and visualizing association rules. At its core, this project leverages a specialized data structure called the **Trie of Rules** to improve the efficiency of rule management, retrieval, and visualization. The methodologies implemented here are a direct result of research on optimizing post-mining processes for ARM.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Structure**: Implements the Trie of Rules for fast storage and retrieval of association rules.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Provides visualization techniques for exploring large association rule sets and understanding substitution patterns.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets with enhanced performance compared to traditional ARM methods.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Trie-of-Rules.git
    cd Trie-of-Rules
    ```
    
## Usage

### Running the Example Notebook

1. Open the `Example.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load datasets, process rules, and visualize results.
